NBA like-player recommeder engine

Modeled after Nathan Carabello's model from: https://nathancarabello.medium.com/nba-scouting-recommendation-engines-with-k-nearest-neighbors-knn-8eb0238a53d9

Using dataset from Kaggle

Download the files from these two links. I only use the cbb21 and all_seasons files for the model
NBA player data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewsundberg/college-basketball-dataset
College team ranking data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/nba-players-data

You can motify the specs to base model off of, currently set to use: age,	draft_round,	draft_number,	gp,	net_rating, and college ranking
